# Thoughts on React Devs

Does your site require react?

No seriously.

If i was giving and interview and I asked you to walk me through the process of sending a form across the web and post it's contents, how would you answer that question?

How much of it would be spent on react or react hooks or styling or the latest ORM library or worrying about tables?

A lot. I've seen this happen a lot during interviews.

Y'all can't even send a form across the net without using React.

Which honestly makes me pretty sad.

Here's the red flags for the interview question:
- HTML and subsequently _the browser_ already have built-in form submissions
- So you don't need react
- You integrated a highly volatile library into a simple interview question
- You will undoubtedly do that during our potential work, you will integrate libraries without understanding challenges.
