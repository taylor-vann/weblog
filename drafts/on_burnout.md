# On Burnout and Doubt

I almost quit Google before I was let go in 2023.
: a behemoth moneny pit named Material and (the unfortunately named) Lit.

I learned a lot from both teams.

But the lessons where clear from the negative space etched from the challenges of scale and deployment.

At work. It's a very what _won't_ I do situation. But that thought never crosses your mind. You hunt for "impact".

Your team spent years solidifying certain APIs. Any change is now a breaking change.  It's an additive process: the engineering equivalent of duct tape.

If this sounds reductive, it's supposed to be. Because that is a bullshit way to engineer anything.

So you attempt to solve a bug but you find it's at the core of an ancient part of your code base. Any attempt to fundamentally change or remove code requires extensive testing. And then you gotta remove tests that tested the previous implementation. So now you're removing code and tests and convincing serveral other coworkers that removing 1000 lines of code and dozens of tests. Code that "worked just fine as long as the client didn't fuck up". And from a managers perspective: 5 years and half a dozen engineers costs around 3million fucking dollars. And now you're talking about changing removing a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of work because yours is slightly better but does the same thing with less code and less bugs? No, you're manager says, fix the fucking bugs. 

What you're really doing is ignoring sunk costs. You


The result is you go into work, creating a product that you wouldn't even use.

My point being, material designers at Google all use iPhones. I was there. I saw it. Nobody building for Android uses Android. And when YOU use Android you can _feel_ that disconnect.

Mainly, if you're burnt out, truly burnt out, you won't know it till you quit your job.

I On the outside you want a little more freedom of movement but now that comes with a lot of: what _not_ to do, , . 

I applied to the Post Office in 2024. I think being a postman is quite respectable really. I felt like it was a good fit considering Data Centers and UI libraries both help send packets of information to people via addresses.
