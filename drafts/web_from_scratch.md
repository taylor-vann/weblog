Id like to talk about some topics in the industry i don't see covered in the broader economy.

Lessons we take for granted. 

There is a fundamental difference between html and other protocols like json and rpc

A user never sends html back to the server.

We don't use html for that kind of communication.

Even in the old days before javascript took over, we sent forms. They're reminiscent of csv with a two column key value relationship.

So why is this important?

It highlights the function of a browser. It underscores the purpose of html.

Hypertext as a user interface.

User interface as an 2d plane.

A 2d plane as an infinite canvas.

I believe this is where our idea of "cyberspace" comes from.

It's in our heads, we understand the limited physical real estate in our corporal day to day.

The physical nature to entertainment was hidebound. Big screens? movie theaters. Need lots of information in a small space microfilms and microtapes.

But we instantly ignore a foundational skuemorph, the representation of an infinite canvas through limited number of physical pixels

And trade that ignorance for a magic looking glass.



And sending html to a computer doesn't mean anything.

In fact it makes it more absurd. Entire industries have been dedicated to page scraping with broad heuristics and fuzzy results.

It fucking sucks scraping pdfs and html for content.

Sending html to a browser however implies there is a person at the other end.
