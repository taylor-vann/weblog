	<h2>How to share domain knowledge quickly</h2>
	<h3>Taylor Vann</h3>
	
	<p>Here is a paper based solution we used at Meta to share domain knowledge across our team.</p>
	<p>It's pretty boring.</p>
	<p>Unless building your coworkers into a cache sounds interesting.</p>
	<p>Or maybe you enjoy watching some index cards and a couple rules compound into a more supportive work environment.</p>
	<p>This exercise works best for small teams.</p>

	<h4>Required materials:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>index cards</li>
		<li>coworkers</li>
		<li>permanent markers</li>
		<li>a parental figure (tech lead or manager)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What are we talking about?</h3>
	<p>
		Domain knowledge is the context required to explain the purpose of
		software architecture; how it operates and performs.
	<p>
	<p>It is critical to successful software.</p>
	<p>
		Domain knowledge separates generalists from specialists. It's a culture
		of delivery and availability. It's a vector with magnitude and direction
		that looks an awful lot like momentum and vision.
	</p>
		Developers use domain knowledge to create meaningful contributions. And their
		cohort can easily understand those contributions. It's the why not the how.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without domain knowledge, software becomes a patchwork held together by
		duct tape and dollar bills.
	</p>
	<p>And that's expensive.</p>
