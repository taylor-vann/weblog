# How to share domain knowledge quickly

Teams

Here's a lloow tech method to quickly share domain knowledge with coworkers.

It's not tech specific. But it is based on caching. I learned it at Faceboook when it was called Facebook.

## Index Card Cache

### Setup

Get a pack of index cards.

Each coworker needs N-1 cards where N is the number of coworkers.

So if there's 4 people on your team, each needs 3, so you need 12 in total

N * (N - 1) = Number of index cards.

Every team mate writes the name of their coworkers on the index cards: one teammate for each card. 

Shuffle the cards. Flip upside down.

This is your main deck.

Youre done. Success!

### The Rules

When you have a question and you don't know the answer, pick the first card in your deck.

Ask the corresponding teammate your question. Even if it's not their specialty. Even if it's not relavent to their work. If that teammate doesn't know either, then you both find a person who does.

Remove card from deck in a discard deck.

When all cards have been used, shuffle the discard deck as a new deck.

Here are the best ways to combat domain knowledge:

You can't!

At least not how you want to.

I've heard it all.

What if you and your team died in a plane accident?

What if you and your team was hit by an asteroid?

What if you took a team building camping vacation and your bus ran off a cliff?

How would you company be able to replace you? Not physically you, your company can and WILL replace you at any time.

## Why

It's not the asteroid or the camping nightmare that's gonna brick your progress.

It's people being out sick, on vacation, in meetings, generally unavailable, mysteriously away from their phone.

That's gonna make a two hour task a two day task. It's going to affect all teams all the time.

This trick also forces communication between all teammates. It's normal to have favorites or accidentally prefer conversations over others.

But that's the initial wall your team needs to get over now. It also gives teammates more opportunities to show how they want to be talked to! You get less friction between coworkers because smaller conversations taught them how to handle bigger conversations.
